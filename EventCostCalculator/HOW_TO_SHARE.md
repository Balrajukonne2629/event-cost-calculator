## Method 8: Create a Release Package

### Professional Distribution:

1. **Create a folder structure:**
```
event-cost-calculator-release/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ event-cost-calculator-1.0.0.jar
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.txt
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ RUN.bat (Windows)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ RUN.sh (Mac/Linux)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ DOCUMENTATION.pdf
```

2. **Create RUN.bat (Windows):**
```batch
@echo off
echo Starting Event Cost Calculator...
java -jar event-cost-calculator-1.0.0.jar
pause
```

3. **Create RUN.sh (Mac/Linux):**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Starting Event Cost Calculator..."
java -jar event-cost-calculator-1.0.0.jar
```

4. **Create README.txt:**
```
EVENT COST CALCULATOR v1.0.0

QUICK START:
- Windows: Double-click RUN.bat
- Mac/Linux: Run ./RUN.sh or chmod +x RUN.sh && ./RUN.sh
